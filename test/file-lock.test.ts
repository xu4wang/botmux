/**
 * Unit tests for `withFileLock`. The interesting paths:
 *   1. Happy path: lock acquired, fn runs, lock released.
 *   2. Concurrency (same process): N Promise.all'd calls serialize.
 *   3. Stale-break: a lock left behind by a dead PID old enough to be
 *      considered stale gets broken via atomic rename — exactly one waiter
 *      wins, others retry. We can't easily simulate two processes within
 *      vitest, but we CAN verify the rename-based path doesn't break in the
 *      single-waiter case (regression coverage for Codex r2 #2).
 *
 * Run:  pnpm vitest run test/file-lock.test.ts
