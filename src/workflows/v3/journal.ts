 * v3 journal — append-only event stream (the run's audit truth).

 * Codex's v1-review blocker #1: v3 is NOT a "only-mutable-STATE" recoverable
 * system.  `journal.ndjson` is the append-only source of audit truth (one JSON
 * object per line, `ts`-stamped) from which `state.ts` materializes the STATE
 * checkpoint.  Concurrency / retry / gate / cancel / failure-root-cause all
 * leave an ordered trail here.
 *
 * Append-only + line-oriented = crash-tolerant by construction: a torn final
 * line (process died mid-write) is skipped on read; everything before it is
 * intact.  No locking needed for the journal itself — appends are serialized
 * by the single runtime loop (the per-node LOCK guards worker dispatch, not
 * the journal).
