/**
 * Worker input-gate — decide whether an incoming Lark message is written to the
 * CLI's PTY now, or queued until the CLI is ready.
 *
 * `pendingMessages` always buffers the message; this only decides whether to
 * kick `flushPending()` immediately. Three "write now" cases:
 *
 *  - `isPromptReady`  — the CLI is idle and waiting for input.
 *  - `isFlushing`     — a drain loop is already running; let it pick this up.
 *  - type-ahead       — the adapter (Codex/CoCo/Claude) can accept input while
 *                       BUSY: the TUI parks it in its own queue / steers it into
 *                       the active turn.
 *
 * The catch the type-ahead case must respect: parking only works once the TUI
 * is actually up. During STARTUP (and tmux re-attach) the input box doesn't
 * exist yet, so a write is silently dropped — this is exactly how dispatch's
 * brief reached Codex ~6s before its first idle and never landed. `awaitingFirstPrompt`
 * is the worker's "hasn't reached ready even once" flag; while it's true we must
 * QUEUE even type-ahead messages and let `markPromptReady()`'s flush deliver them.
