/**
 * Worker input-gate — decide whether an incoming Lark message is written to the
 * CLI's PTY now, or queued until the CLI is ready.
 *
 * `pendingMessages` always buffers the message; this only decides whether to
 * kick `flushPending()` immediately. Three "write now" cases:
 *
 *  - `isPromptReady`  — the CLI is idle and waiting for input.
 *  - `isFlushing`     — a drain loop is already running; let it pick this up.
 *  - type-ahead       — the adapter (Codex/CoCo/Claude) can accept input while
 *                       BUSY: the TUI parks it in its own queue / steers it into
 *                       the active turn.
 *
 * The catch the type-ahead case must respect: parking only works once the TUI
 * is actually up. During STARTUP (and tmux re-attach) the input box doesn't
 * exist yet, so a write is silently dropped — this is exactly how dispatch's
 * brief reached Codex ~6s before its first idle and never landed. `awaitingFirstPrompt`
 * is the worker's "hasn't reached ready even once" flag; while it's true we must
 * QUEUE even type-ahead messages and let `markPromptReady()`'s flush deliver them.

/**
 * After the ready-gate releases (SessionStart/direct-ready signal OR the timeout

 * mark the prompt ready (which flushes for ALL adapters) vs. just calling
 * flushPending() (which only flushes for type-ahead adapters). Marking ready is
 * correct when ANY of these hold:
 *   - promptReadyAfterSettle         — an authoritative direct ready command
 *                                      fired (Hermes). Claude passes false here
 *                                      and waits for post-hook PTY evidence.
 *   - promptReadyDetectedDuringSettle — the idle detector fired during the
 *                                      settle (a readyPattern/idle proved readiness).
 *   - readyPatternSeenDuringHold      — a readyPattern fired WHILE the gate was
 *                                      holding (markPromptReady was blocked by
 *                                      readyGate.shouldHold()). The input box
 *                                      exists; the gate only deferred delivery.
 *
 * Pins the Hermes regression: a non-type-ahead adapter that renders its prompt
 * (❯) during the hold but never fires the SessionStart signal must be marked
 * ready at settle — otherwise settle calls flushPending(), which bails on
 * !isPromptReady && !typeAheadAllowed and leaves the first message queued until
 * the hard timeout (and, before the hard-timeout fix, forever).
