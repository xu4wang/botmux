/**
 * Shared stdin-injection path for the "runner" CLI adapters (codex-app, mira).
 *
 * These adapters don't drive a TUI — they spawn a small Node runner that reads
 * its stdin raw, byte-by-byte, and enqueues a message only when it sees a
 * trailing newline (see codex-app-runner.ts / mira-runner.ts). botmux hands the
 * runner one control line per message:
 *
 *     ::botmux-<id>:<base64(JSON)>\n
 *
 * The naive implementation wrote the WHOLE line in a single
 * `tmux send-keys -l -- <line>`. For a large message (e.g. a Code Review
 * webhook whose full MR JSON is embedded — ~16-21KB after base64) that single
 * injection overruns the pane pty's input buffer (N_TTY's ~4KB read buffer):
 * tmux's write blocks until the reader drains, which takes longer than
 * execFileSync's 5s timeout, so the send-keys is killed and the keystroke is
 * silently dropped — yet the old writeInput still reported `submitted: true`,
 * wedging the session "busy" forever. (Compare claude-code, which throttles
 * its send-keys for exactly this reason; codex-app/mira were the only naive
 * single-shot writers.)
 *
 * Fix: split the line into small chunks and inject them with a short throttle
 * between writes, so no single send-keys overruns the buffer and the reader
 * keeps draining. Crucially we never inject a newline between chunks — the
 * runner accumulates the partial line in its own buffer and only acts on the
 * final Enter — so splitting mid-line is safe. The control line is pure ASCII
 * (marker + base64 alphabet), so 1 char == 1 byte and slicing by code unit is
 * a clean byte split.

 * Write one control line to a runner adapter's stdin, chunked + throttled.

 * Returns `{ submitted: false }` when any chunk (or the final Enter) fails to

 * alive keystroke, so a genuine drop is now surfaced to the worker (which raises
 * a submit-failure notice + recheck so the user can retry) instead of being
 * swallowed as a false success.
 *
 * Buffer-hygiene contract (the runner only clears its stdin buffer on a newline,
 * see handleInput in codex-app-runner.ts / mira-runner.ts — a half-written
 * control line with no trailing Enter lingers and would PREPEND to the next
 * message, corrupting both into one un-parseable blob):
 *   - Pre-flush: emit one Enter before writing, terminating any partial line a
 *     prior failed write may have left behind (runner discards the fragment as
 *     bad input; an empty buffer just ignores the blank line).
 *   - On a dropped chunk: emit a flush Enter so the partial we just wrote can't
 *     merge with the next message, then report non-submission (submit-failure).
 *   - Submit Enter is retried — a single dropped Enter would otherwise leave a
 *     COMPLETE but unsubmitted line in the buffer.
