## Why botmux?

### Design Philosophy

Core philosophy: **Bridge CLIs, don't rebuild them**. botmux doesn't reimplement Agent capabilities — it bridges existing AI coding CLIs (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, OpenCode, Antigravity) directly. Memory, context management, tool use, permission systems — these capabilities are evolving rapidly within the CLIs themselves. botmux rides on top of that evolution rather than rebuilding in parallel. Every CLI upgrade benefits botmux automatically with zero adaptation.

### Key Advantages

Compared to OpenClaw-style approaches built on Agent SDKs:

| Feature | botmux | OpenClaw-style |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| Architecture | Bridges full CLI processes directly | Rebuilds on Agent SDK |
| CLI Capabilities | Full runtime (hooks, memory, plan mode, skills, `/` commands) | SDK API subset, missing features must be reimplemented |
| CLI Upgrades | Zero-adaptation automatic benefit | Must track SDK version changes |
| Memory / Context | Reuses CLI's built-in memory system, improves as the CLI evolves | Must build custom memory system, duplicating CLI-native capabilities |
| Multi-CLI Support | 6 CLIs, switch with one config (Claude Code / Codex / Cursor / Gemini / OpenCode / Antigravity) | Tied to a single SDK, cannot switch CLIs |
| Web Terminal | Interactive full terminal, mobile shortcut toolbar, phone/desktop/Lark tri-screen sync | Usually web chat UI or read-only output |
| Multi-Bot Collaboration | Multiple bots in same group via @mention routing, isolated processes, different CLIs sparring | Usually single bot |
| Terminal Access | tmux attach directly into the CLI process, same as local dev experience | No direct terminal access |
| Installation | `npm install -g botmux`, 5-min Lark setup | Easy to install, but more configuration needed |

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** >= 20
- **AI coding CLI / local agent app** installed and authenticated (`claude`, `codex`, `coco`, `cursor-agent`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `hermes`, or `agy` (Antigravity) in PATH)
  - **CoCo requires `0.120.32+`**: type-ahead (sending a new message while a turn is still running, parked in CoCo's own message queue) relies on 0.120.32+ behavior; earlier versions may drop or serialize input while busy — upgrade before use
- **tmux** >= 3.x (optional — auto-enabled when installed for persistent CLI sessions)
- **CJK fonts** (only needed for screenshot rendering of Chinese text / emoji):
  - macOS: ships with PingFang / Hiragino, no action needed
  - Debian/Ubuntu: daemon will background-install `fonts-noto-cjk fonts-noto-color-emoji` on first boot if missing (requires passwordless sudo or running as root; restart the daemon after install)
  - Other Linux distros: install Noto CJK + Noto Color Emoji manually (package names vary)

## 5-Minute Setup

> 💡 **TL;DR**: `npm i -g botmux` → `botmux setup` and **scan two QR codes** to get a working bot → `botmux start`. The 1st scan creates the app and saves the AppID/AppSecret (event subscriptions + bot capability pre-configured); the 2nd scan lets botmux's built-in Feishu Web login **import permissions, configure the redirect URL, and create + submit a publish version automatically**. The entire Open Platform config (create app / permissions / redirect / publish) is handled by setup; pass `--no-open-platform-auto` to skip the second auto-config step and use the manual steps folded at the end.

### 1. Install botmux

```bash
npm install -g botmux
```

> Requires **Node.js ≥ 20**, with at least one AI coding CLI installed and authenticated (`claude` / `codex` / `cursor-agent` / `gemini` / `opencode` / `coco` / `agy` on your PATH). Installing **tmux** too is recommended (enables session persistence automatically).

### 2. Create the App & Configure (`botmux setup`)

Run `botmux setup` and follow the interactive menu:

1. **New config**: type `1` and press Enter (with an existing config, type `2` to add a bot).
2. **Create the bot**: type `1` → **Scan-to-create (recommended)**: scan with the Lark mobile app and a PersonalAgent app is created with AppID/AppSecret persisted automatically, **with event subscriptions + bot capability pre-configured** — no manual browser navigation. Uses the official `@larksuiteoapi/node-sdk` device flow. (You can also type `2` to paste AppID/Secret manually — see "Create the app manually" folded below.)
3. **Pick the CLI**: choose the CLI to bridge (e.g. type `1` for Claude Code).
4. **Default working dir**: usually the **parent directory** of your git projects (e.g. `~/projects`); new topics scan **downward** for git repos (up to 3 levels). Avoid `~` (too many folders to traverse).

Then comes the **2nd scan**: botmux's built-in Feishu Web login automatically imports permissions, configures the `http://127.0.0.1:9768/callback` redirect URL, and creates + submits a publish version. On failure it falls back and prints the manual steps (folded below) without affecting the config already written; importing only part of the permissions still counts as success — add the rest later on the Open Platform.

> ⚠️ **Currently only Feishu (feishu.cn) tenants are supported.** If scan detects a Lark international (larksuite.com) tenant, setup aborts — the daemon runtime (Lark Client/WSClient/event-dispatcher) hasn't been wired up for the `larksuite.com` domain yet. A follow-up PR will add full Lark support.

At the end, setup validates credentials with a `tenant_access_token` call (only writing `bots.json` on success) and writes the full scope JSON to `~/.botmux/lark-scopes.json` for reference.

### 3. Start

```bash
botmux start
```

> `start` re-validates credentials before forking workers; missing scopes only WARN, they don't block the daemon. If you later need to verify the event subscription, Lark requires the daemon to be running so it can detect the WebSocket connection.

### 4. Create a Group and Start Chatting

1. Create a **topic-enabled group** in Lark
2. Open group settings → Group Bots → add the bot you just created
3. Send a message in the group — the bot responds automatically

![Add bot to group](docs/setup/add-bot-to-group.png)

### 5. Enable Boot-time Autostart (recommended)

After confirming the bot can send/receive messages, run:

```bash
botmux autostart enable
```

This registers the daemon with your user init system (macOS launchd / Linux user systemd) — **no sudo needed**. It restarts automatically on reboot. See [CLI Commands § Autostart](#autostart) below.

<details>
<summary><b>Manual Open Platform config: create app / permissions / redirect / publish (fallback)</b> —— handled automatically by botmux setup during the 2nd scan; expand only if auto-config failed or you want to verify manually</summary>

<br>

**Create the app manually**: go to the [Lark Open Platform](https://open.larkoffice.com/app), create a "Custom App", copy **App ID / App Secret** from "Credentials & Basic Info", and in `botmux setup`'s "Create the bot" step choose `2` to paste them back.

![Create App](docs/setup/create-app.png)

**Add permissions**: run the copy-to-clipboard command setup printed, then go to "Permissions & Scopes" → "Batch Import/Export" and paste. Submit for review — visibility "only me" auto-approves.

![Permissions](docs/setup/permissions.png)

The full JSON lives at `~/.botmux/lark-scopes.json` (also tracked in-repo at [src/setup/lark-scopes.json](src/setup/lark-scopes.json), kept in sync with the internal wiki, covers ~290 tenant + user scopes).

```bash
# macOS (local)
cat ~/.botmux/lark-scopes.json | pbcopy
# Linux desktop (local X server)
cat ~/.botmux/lark-scopes.json | xclip -selection clipboard
# SSH / headless: just cat — selecting in your local terminal copies to your local clipboard
cat ~/.botmux/lark-scopes.json
# SSH via OSC 52 — write to local clipboard through terminal (iTerm2 / kitty / WezTerm / Alacritty / tmux 1.5+)
base64 -w0 < ~/.botmux/lark-scopes.json | awk 'BEGIN{printf "\033]52;c;"}{printf "%s",$0}END{printf "\a"}'
```

**Add redirect URL (optional)**: if you plan to use `/login` inside Lark to let botmux act on your behalf for docs / calendar / wiki / sheets, add a redirect URL under "Security Settings" → "Redirect URL": `http://127.0.0.1:9768/callback`. Skip this if you only need bot messaging.

**Publish**: go to "Version Management & Release", click "Create Version" and publish. Set availability to "Visible to me only" for automatic approval.

![Publish](docs/setup/publish.png)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Troubleshoot — bot not receiving messages</b></summary>

<br>

PersonalAgent apps come with event subscription + bot capability configured by default, so normally you don't touch this. If the bot **receives no messages at all** (not even DMs) after following the steps above, verify these two:

- **Event subscription**: Open Platform → your app → Events & Callbacks → should subscribe to `im.message.receive_v1` + `card.action.trigger` (subscribed by default; add manually if missing). The delivery method must be "Receive events via long connection" (WebSocket), with the botmux daemon running.
- **Bot capability**: Open Platform → your app → Features → Bot should be enabled (on by default); name/avatar are editable.

Then restart the daemon: `botmux restart`.

</details>

## Features

### Streaming Cards

Each conversation turn gets a live-updating Feishu card that shows:

- Real-time terminal output rendered as Markdown, TUI chrome auto-filtered to show only actual work output
- Status indicator: Starting > Working > Idle
- Action buttons: Open Terminal, Get Write Link, Restart CLI, Close Session


### Web Terminal (Interactive)

Each session exposes a web terminal at `http://<WEB_EXTERNAL_HOST>:<port>`.

- **Read-only link** — shown on the streaming card in the group thread
- **Write-enabled link** — sent via DM on demand (click "Get Write Link" on the card)

On mobile/tablet, a floating shortcut toolbar provides Esc, Ctrl+C, Tab, arrow keys and other control keys missing from virtual keyboards — full CLI control from your phone.

### Multi-Bot Collaboration

Run multiple Lark bots on a single machine, each mapped to a different CLI. In the same group chat, messages are routed via @mention — each bot gets its own isolated CLI process. With a single bot in the group, it responds automatically without @. In a regular (non-topic) group, `@<bot1> @<bot2> /t xxx` spawns one independent thread per mentioned bot anchored at the same message. Send `@<bot1> @<bot2> /introduce` once so they register each other's open_id; afterwards each bot can explicitly @-mention the others from within its own session (see [§ Slash Commands](#slash-commands)).

### Tmux Persistence

When tmux is installed, botmux automatically uses it. CLI processes persist inside tmux sessions — all features work unchanged.

**Key benefit: daemon restarts don't interrupt the CLI.** During `botmux restart`, the worker process exits but the tmux session (and the CLI inside it) keeps running. The next incoming message triggers a re-attach — no `--resume` context reload needed.

```bash
# Interactive session picker — select and attach to tmux (see § CLI Commands)
botmux list

# Or manually attach (session name = bmx-<first 8 chars of session ID>)
tmux attach -t bmx-<first-8-chars-of-session-id>
# Ctrl+B, D to detach — CLI keeps running

# Force pure pty mode (disable tmux)
BACKEND_TYPE=pty botmux start
```

**Lifecycle:**

| Event | tmux session | CLI process |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| `botmux restart` | Survives | Survives (re-attaches on next message) |
| `/close` or close button | Destroyed | Terminated (SIGHUP) |
| CLI exits / crashes | Closes with it | Already exited (auto-restart creates new session) |

### Session Adopt

Seamlessly connect Botmux to CLI processes already running in tmux — monitor and interact from your phone via Lark.

```
/adopt              # Scan tmux, show selection card
/adopt 0:2.0        # Directly adopt a specific tmux pane
```

- **Shared mode** — After adopting, iTerm2 and Lark stay in sync: streaming card shows real-time terminal output, Lark chat input is forwarded directly to the terminal
- **One-click takeover** — Click the "Takeover" button on the streaming card to rebuild the session with `--resume` and convert to a standard Botmux session
- **Safe disconnect** — Click "Disconnect" to detach Botmux without affecting the original CLI

### Scheduled Tasks

Three schedule types (once / interval / cron) with Chinese/English natural
language, executed inside the original thread (no new topic per run).

**Two ways to create**:
- **Slash command** (quick): `/schedule 每日17:50 check AI news`
- **Conversation** (flexible): just tell the agent "add a reminder for every day at 9:00 to check deploys" — the `botmux-schedule` Skill fires automatically.

Supported formats: Chinese NL (`每日17:50` / `30分钟后` / `明天9:00`),
English duration (`30m`), interval (`every 2h`), cron (`0 9 * * *`),
ISO timestamp (`2026-05-01T10:00`).

### Lark integration (Skill + CLI)

When a CLI spawns inside a botmux session it automatically gets
`~/.botmux/bin` on PATH plus a set of ready-to-use Skills:

- `botmux send` — send a message to the current thread (text, images, files, @mention)
- `botmux history` — fetch session history (topic groups → in-thread, regular groups → whole chat)
- `botmux quoted <message_id>` — when the user @ed the bot via Lark's quote-reply UI, fetch the quoted message on demand
- `botmux bots list` — discover bots + their `open_id`s
- `botmux schedule` — manage scheduled tasks

These capabilities are wired via `--append-system-prompt` and Skill
descriptions, so the agent picks them up automatically. Compared to
Anthropic's official Telegram channel — which exposes each action as an
MCP tool — the Skill + CLI combo skips the MCP handshake on every CLI
launch, doesn't burn tool-list tokens, and works across every CLI that
can read a system prompt and shell out (Claude Code / Codex / Cursor /
Gemini / OpenCode / Antigravity), with no MCP protocol support required.

### Dashboard

> `botmux dashboard` issues a one-time-token URL — manage every daemon/bot from the browser.

- One-click locate back to the Feishu thread / open Web Terminal / multi-select batch close
- Create a new group with auto owner-transfer + @-mention notification
- Disband or leave a chat (associated sessions auto-closed)
- **Workflows console**:
  - Run List (5 s poll) + Run Detail with summary, dangling-work red panel, node/activity table, event timeline, and a **parallel-execution timeline** (attempt-level), auto-stopping polling once the run reaches a terminal state
  - **Cancel a run directly from the dashboard**; approve / reject `humanGate` with reviewer comments
  - **Workflow Catalog**: lists every workflow under `~/.botmux/workflows/`, drills into schema / dependency graph, and triggers a new run from the UI (with params input)
  - IM approval / cancel cards remain available; `botmux workflow` CLI subcommands also keep working

## Usage

### Workflow

1. Send a message in a Lark topic group to create a new thread; or in a regular group send `/t <prompt>` to force-open a new topic
2. The bot shows a repo selection card — pick a project or click "Start directly" (chats bound via `/oncall bind` skip this step)
3. The CLI spawns in the selected directory
4. A live streaming card appears in the thread, showing real-time terminal output with markdown rendering
5. Each reply creates a new streaming card for that turn; previous cards freeze at their last state
6. Click "Get Write Link" on the card to receive a write-enabled terminal URL via DM
7. The CLI replies in the thread via the `botmux send` command (wired through the `botmux-send` Skill)

### Slash Commands

Send these straight into a topic — the daemon intercepts them (no clash with the underlying CLI's own slash commands: any `/xxx` botmux doesn't recognize is forwarded verbatim to the CLI). Send `/help` anytime to see the same list inside the topic.

**📌 Session management**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/repo` | While a repo is pending selection, launch in the default workingDir; mid-session, show the project selector card (interactive dropdown + text list) |
| `/repo <N>` | Switch to Nth project from last scan |
| `/repo <path\|name>` | Skip the selector card; pass a path (relative/absolute) or a first-level project name under workingDir |
| `/cd <path>` | Change working directory and restart the CLI process |
| `/status` | Show session info (uptime, terminal URL, etc.) |
| `/restart` | Restart CLI process (keeps the session context) |
| `/close` | Close session and send a resumable card (with the CLI's native resume command) |
| `/t <prompt>` / `/topic <prompt>` | Force-open a new topic from a non-topic group (shows the repo selector); empty prompt is allowed — fill it in after picking the repo |

**🔀 Forwarded to the underlying CLI**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/compact` `/model` `/clear` `/plugin` `/usage` `/context` `/cost` `/mcp` `/diff` `/code-review` `/security-review` `/review` `/btw` | Sent verbatim to the underlying CLI for its own built-in slash commands (e.g. Claude Code's `/compact` / `/context`, Codex's `/diff` / `/btw`) |

**⏰ Scheduled tasks** (syntax & examples in [§ Scheduled Task Management](#scheduled-task-management))

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/schedule <natural language / cron>` | Create a task, e.g. `/schedule 每日17:50 check AI news` |
| `/schedule list` | List all scheduled tasks |
| `/schedule remove\|enable\|disable\|run <id>` | Remove / enable / disable / run once |

**📡 Session adoption**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/adopt` | Scan local tmux and pop a card to adopt a running CLI session |
| `/adopt <tmux_pane>` | Adopt a specific tmux pane directly (e.g. `/adopt 0:2.0`) |

**🔐 User authorization**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/login` | Lark user OAuth — afterwards you can download third-party card images and call cloud-doc/calendar APIs as yourself |
| `/login status` | Show current OAuth status |

**🛎️ Oncall mode (group chats)**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/oncall bind <path>` | Bind current chat to a project dir, skip the repo card (any group member can @ the bot; buttons / daemon commands still gated by `allowedUsers`) |
| `/oncall unbind` | Unbind the current chat |
| `/oncall status` | Inspect the current chat's oncall binding |

**🔑 Access grants (owner only)**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@bot /grant @someone` | Pop an authorization card to add the user to the "this chat" or "global" allowlist; you can @ several people/bots at once (one card lists every target, one scope click applies to all); if a granted target is a bot, it's auto-registered into the roster on success (an implicit `/introduce`) for cross-bot collaboration; also auto-pops (and @s the owner) when an unauthorized user @-mentions the bot |
| `@bot /revoke @someone` | Revoke the user's this-chat + global access; you can @ several people/bots at once |

**🆕 One-shot session group**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/group <name>` (alias `/g`) | Auto-create a new Lark group, invite you, transfer ownership; the whole group acts as one chat-scope CLI session. Empty name falls back to a timestamp. The group does **not** auto-start a session — just go in and start chatting with the bot. Any bots you @-mention in the command are pulled into the new group (the first mentioned bot does the creating). |

**👥 Multi-bot collaboration**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `@botA @botB /t <prompt>` | With multiple bots, each @-mentioned bot opens its own independent topic from the same message |
| `@botA @botB /introduce` | Bots register each other's open_id so they can later explicitly @-mention one another across sessions (any @ order, extra text allowed; roster-only, grants no permission — **anyone in the chat can run it, no authorization needed**) |

**❓ Help**

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/help` | Show the full command list above, inside the topic |

### Scheduled Task Management

Two creation paths are covered above in [Scheduled Tasks](#scheduled-tasks); below is just the slash-command syntax and management commands.

```bash
# Chinese NL
/schedule 每日17:50 check AI news
/schedule 工作日每天9:00 run health check
/schedule 每周一10:00 generate weekly report

# One-shot
/schedule 30分钟后 verify deployment
/schedule 明天9:00 standup reminder

# English / cron
/schedule every 2h probe services
/schedule 30m remind me to drink water
/schedule 0 9 * * * good morning

# Manage
/schedule list
/schedule remove|enable|disable|run <id>
```

**Execution behavior**: the task fires inside the **original thread where it was created** — no new topic per run. Working directory is preserved. If the original session is still alive, the prompt is injected into it; otherwise a fresh worker spawns bound to the same thread root.

---

## Configuration

Configure bots via `~/.botmux/bots.json`. Run `botmux setup` to create it interactively, or edit manually.

```bash
# Interactive setup
botmux setup
```

When `~/.botmux/bots.json` already exists, `botmux setup` can add a bot, reconfigure from scratch, edit an existing bot, or delete a bot config. The edit/delete flow accepts the process name shown by `botmux status` (e.g. `botmux-1` or a custom `botmux-claude-main`) or the `larkAppId`; empty input keeps the current value, and `-` clears optional fields such as `name`, `model`, `backendType`, `workingDir`, and `allowedUsers`. Changing `larkAppId` asks for confirmation because historical session/chat state under the old app ID is not migrated automatically. Deleting a bot only removes one local `bots.json` entry; it does not delete the Lark app, historical messages, or local session data. Run `botmux restart` for changes to take effect.

**bots.json format:**

```json
[
  {
    "larkAppId": "cli_xxx_bot1",
    "larkAppSecret": "secret_1",
    "name": "claude-main",
    "cliId": "claude-code",
    "model": "sonnet",
    "workingDir": "~/projects",
    "allowedUsers": ["alice@company.com"],
    "allowedChatGroups": ["oc_xxx_team"]
  },
  {
    "larkAppId": "cli_xxx_bot2",
    "larkAppSecret": "secret_2",
    "cliId": "codex",
    "model": "gpt-5-codex",
    "workingDir": "~/work"
  }
]
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `larkAppId` | Yes | Lark app ID |
| `larkAppSecret` | Yes | Lark app secret |
| `name` | No | Process name suffix shown by `botmux status`; e.g. `claude-main` appears as `botmux-claude-main`, defaults to `botmux-<index>` |
| `cliId` | No | CLI adapter, defaults to `claude-code` (options: `aiden`, `coco`, `codex`, `codex-app`, `cursor`, `gemini`, `opencode`, `antigravity`, `hermes`) |
| `model` | No | Model name used when spawning the CLI. Currently honored by: `claude-code`, `codex`, `coco`, `cursor`, `gemini`, `opencode`; other adapters ignore the field. Leave empty to use the CLI default. `botmux setup` proposes per-CLI candidates plus a free-form Other option. |
| `cliPathOverride` | No | Absolute path to the CLI entry, for wrappers / routers; typical use: `ccr`, `claude-w`, `aiden-x-claude`, etc. |
| `backendType` | No | Session backend: `pty` or `tmux` (auto-detected by default) |
| `workingDir` | No | Default working directory, supports comma-separated. The new-topic repo-select card scans for git repos **from this directory downward** (recursive, up to 3 levels), no longer climbing to the parent: point it at a repos root (e.g. `~/projects`) to list every repo beneath it, or at a single repo to list just that repo (and its linked worktrees) |
| `defaultWorkingDir` | No | Single-repo default: new topics with no oncall binding and no peer-session inheritance spawn directly here, skipping the repo-select card. `/cd <path>` still switches mid-session; the next new topic falls back to this default. **Difference from `defaultOncall`:** does NOT write `oncallChats` and does NOT change the `canTalk` / `canOperate` permission model |
| `allowedUsers` | No | Allowed users (**full emails** like `alice@example.com`, or open_ids `ou_xxx`). Email prefixes can't be resolved and are dropped. Required (at least one entry, as owner) when `allowedChatGroups` is set |
| `allowedChatGroups` | No | Talk-open chats (`chat_id`, for example `oc_xxx`). Any member talking **inside these chats** can use the bot (decided by the message's chat — new members work immediately, removed members lose access, no restart needed); grants `canTalk` only, sensitive ops still require `allowedUsers`. Equivalent to the owner running `/grant` (no target) in that chat. |
| `globalGrants` | No | Global talk allowlist (`open_id` list, e.g. `ou_xxx`; humans or bots). Listed entries can talk to the bot in **any** chat; grants `canTalk` only, sensitive ops still require `allowedUsers`. Usually written via the owner's `/grant` card (the "grant talk globally" button); can also be set manually here. |
| `oncallChats` | No | Oncall bindings (written by `/oncall bind`), e.g. `[{ "chatId": "oc_xxx", "workingDir": "~/projects/foo" }]`; any group member can @ the bot |

**Config priority:** `BOTS_CONFIG` env var > `~/.botmux/bots.json`

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `BOTS_CONFIG` | _(unset)_ | Path to bots.json (overrides default location) |
| `WEB_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | HTTP server bind address |
| `WEB_EXTERNAL_HOST` | _(auto-detect LAN IP)_ | External hostname/IP for terminal URLs |
| `SESSION_DATA_DIR` | `~/.botmux/data` | Where sessions and queues are stored |
| `DEBUG` | _(unset)_ | Set to `1` for debug logging |

### File Locations

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `~/.botmux/bots.json` | Bot configuration |
| `~/.botmux/data/` | Session data, message queues |
| `~/.botmux/logs/` | Daemon logs |

---

## CLI Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `botmux setup` | Interactive setup (first-time / add / edit / delete bots) |
| `botmux start` | Start daemon (PM2 managed) |
| `botmux stop` | Stop daemon |
| `botmux restart` | Restart daemon (auto-restores active sessions) |
| `botmux logs` | View daemon logs (`--lines N` for more) |
| `botmux status` | Show daemon status |
| `botmux upgrade` | Upgrade to latest version |
| `botmux list` | List all active sessions (alias: `ls`) |
| `botmux delete <id>` | Close a session by ID prefix (alias: `del`/`rm`) |
| `botmux delete all` | Close all active sessions |

### Boot-time Autostart

`botmux autostart enable` registers the daemon with your user's init system so it comes back automatically after a reboot:

- **macOS**: writes `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.botmux.daemon.plist` and loads it via `launchctl bootstrap`. **No sudo required.**
- **Linux**: writes `~/.config/systemd/user/botmux.service` and runs `systemctl --user enable --now`. **No sudo required.**
  - On servers / headless boxes the user systemd manager stops when you log out. To survive logouts and reboots, also run `sudo loginctl enable-linger <your-user>` — `autostart enable` warns when linger is off.
  - Containers / SSH-only sessions without a user DBus fall back to printing manual instructions.
- The `node` and `cli.js` paths baked into the unit come from `process.execPath` at install time. After switching nvm/fnm versions, run `botmux autostart enable` once to rewrite. `botmux start`/`restart` also detect path drift and refresh the unit in place — no manual step needed.
- `enable` / `disable` **only manage the autostart hook — they do not touch a running daemon**. To start the daemon right away run `botmux start`; to stop it run `botmux stop`. This avoids the "I just wanted to turn off autostart, why did my service also die" footgun.
- If you prefer letting systemd own the lifecycle (`systemctl --user start/stop botmux`), that works too — the unit declares `ExecStop=botmux stop` for a clean shutdown path.

### Agent-facing subcommands

Run from inside a botmux-spawned CLI session — session context is auto-detected via ancestor process markers:

| Subcommand | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `botmux send [content]` | Send a message to the current thread (stdin / heredoc / `--content-file`; `--images` / `--files` / `--mention` flags) |
| `botmux bots list` | List bots in the current chat (includes `open_id` for `--mention`) |
| `botmux history [--limit N]` | Fetch session message history (JSON); topic groups → in-thread, regular groups → whole chat |
| `botmux quoted <message_id>` | Fetch a single quoted message (JSON); the ID comes from the daemon-injected `[用户引用了消息 用 botmux quoted om_xxx 查看]` prefix |
| `botmux schedule add <schedule> <prompt>` | Create a scheduled task bound to the current thread |
| `botmux schedule list/remove/pause/resume/run` | Manage scheduled tasks |

These require the `~/.botmux/bin/botmux` wrapper, which the daemon writes at startup and prepends to the worker's `PATH` — always matches the running daemon's version (no `npm i -g` needed).

## Web Dashboard

botmux ships a LAN-accessible Web Dashboard for managing all sessions and scheduled tasks across every configured bot.

```bash
botmux dashboard
# prints: http://<lan-ip>:7891/?t=<token>
```

Each invocation rotates the token — previous URLs are invalidated immediately. This is by design, so a leaked link stops working as soon as you fetch a new one.

v1 features:
- **Sessions board** — every active and closed session across every bot, filterable by CLI / status / adopt / free-text. The detail drawer exposes a "📍 定位到飞书话题" button that posts a marker into the original thread (workaround for Feishu having no public topic deep-link), then opens AppLink to the chat. Also: copy IDs, close session, open xterm.
- **Schedules board** — every scheduled task across every bot, with Run-now / Pause / Resume actions.

Environment variables (set in `~/.botmux/.env`):

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `BOTMUX_DASHBOARD_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Dashboard HTTP bind address |
| `BOTMUX_DASHBOARD_PORT` | `7891` | Dashboard HTTP port |
| `BOTMUX_DASHBOARD_EXTERNAL_HOST` | `WEB_EXTERNAL_HOST` or LAN-IP autodetect | Host used in the printed URL |
| `BOTMUX_DAEMON_IPC_BASE_PORT` | `7892` | Per-daemon IPC port = base + botIndex |

The dashboard runs as its own pm2 process (`botmux-dashboard`) — `pnpm daemon:restart` brings it up alongside every bot daemon. Each daemon exposes a localhost-only IPC at `127.0.0.1:7892+botIndex`; the dashboard process is a thin reverse proxy + token gate. The HMAC secret at `~/.botmux/.dashboard-secret` (mode `0600`) is generated on first start and is used only to sign `botmux dashboard` rotation requests — it never reaches the browser.
