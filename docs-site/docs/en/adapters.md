# Multi-CLI Adapters

botmux bridges different CLIs through adapters, selected via `cliId` in `bots.json`. One-click switching, process isolation.

## Supported CLIs

| `cliId` | CLI | Supports model param |
|---------|-----|:--:|
| `claude-code` | Claude Code (default) | ✅ |
| `codex` | Codex | ✅ |
| `codex-app` | Codex App | |
| `cursor` | Cursor (cursor-agent) | ✅ |
| `gemini` | Gemini | ✅ |
| `opencode` | OpenCode | ✅ |
| `coco` | CoCo / Trae (requires ≥ 0.120.32) | ✅ |
| `aiden` | Aiden | |
| `antigravity` | Antigravity (agy) | |
| `hermes` | Hermes | |
| `copilot` | GitHub Copilot (copilot) | ✅ |

> There are also community-contributed integrations such as MTR, ttadk, and Mira. The `model` field only takes effect for adapters that support a model parameter; others ignore it.

## Mir CLI and MCP Bridge

When you choose **Mira -> Mir CLI (local mircli)** in `botmux setup`, the bot is configured with `cliId: "mir"`. This adapter runs the local `mircli -p --lean`, so the same system user that runs the botmux daemon must already have Mir CLI authenticated and initialized.

BotMux does not need any DevBox-specific configuration. The same rules apply on DevBox, local macOS, or other Linux machines:

- `mircli` can be found by botmux, or the bot config points `cliPathOverride` at the absolute `mircli` path.
- `~/.mira/config.json` already contains a `device_id`. This is usually written by `mircli mcp --device-id <id>` or Mir CLI's own initialization flow.
- `miramcp` is installed in a standard Mir CLI location such as `~/.local/bin/miramcp` or `~/.local/bin/mira_cli`, or `MIRAMCP_BIN` points at the executable.

When a `cliId: "mir"` session starts and receives a message, BotMux best-effort starts the MCP Bridge before invoking `mircli`:

```bash
miramcp run --device-id <device_id>
```

It first checks `~/.mira/miramcp/miramcp.pid` and local port `9801`, so an already-running bridge is reused instead of started twice. To inspect the bridge, run this as the same user that runs the botmux daemon:

```bash
mircli mcp status
```

To disable this autostart behavior, either set this in `~/.mira/config.json`:

```json
{"auto_start_bridge": false}
```

or disable it only for BotMux:

```bash
MIRCLI_AUTO_START_MIRAMCP=0 botmux start
```

## Wrapping a wrapper / gateway integration

In many cases you don't run the native CLI directly but wrap it with a gateway / router (internal proxy + SSO, model routing, etc.), such as `ccr`, `ttadk`, `aiden x claude`, `aiden x codex`. In this case you **don't need a new adapter**: `cliId` still holds the real underlying CLI (`claude-code` / `codex` …), and you only swap the launch entry point for a **wrapper script**, pointing to it with `cliPathOverride` (the "CLI executable path override" when editing a bot in `botmux setup` is exactly this).

**Four general steps:**

1. **Log in to the gateway first** (one-time): complete the SSO login as the **same system user** that runs the daemon; the token is cached in that user's home directory. An expired token will pop an interactive login that blocks the PTY, so keep the login state alive.
2. **Write the wrapper script** in `~/.botmux/bin/`, passing the arguments botmux injects through to the real CLI (note: some gateways reject the `--settings` botmux injects, so strip it in the script).
3. **`chmod +x` to add the executable bit (the easiest one to miss!)** — botmux uses node-pty to exec the script directly; without the executable bit you get `EACCES`, the CLI exits immediately on launch, and the bot crashes and restarts.
4. **Verify by executing the script directly** (use `~/.botmux/bin/xxx --version`, don't test with `bash xxx` — running via bash doesn't need the executable bit and will mask the problem in step 3). Then configure `cliPathOverride` in `bots.json` (use an **absolute path**, not `~`), and run `botmux restart` to take effect.

For the **specific wrapper scripts** of each gateway, use the docs published by the corresponding CLI / gateway team. This public repository intentionally does not include internal document links or copied internal content.

- **aiden × claude / aiden × codex** — aiden×codex needs `script` to force a PTY
- **ttadk** — pay attention to wrapper argument forwarding and login state
- **MTR** — community-contributed, `npm i -g @metamove-code/mtr-cli@latest`
>
> A general technique for troubleshooting wrapper issues: run `botmux logs`, find the `Spawning fresh CLI:` line, copy the full command, and run it manually locally to pinpoint the problem (permissions / argument blacklist / login state).

## Adding a new adapter (contributors)

1. Create a new file under `src/adapters/cli/` implementing the `CliAdapter` interface
2. Add the new ID to the `CliId` union type in `src/adapters/cli/types.ts`
3. Add the import / switch case / export in `src/adapters/cli/registry.ts`
4. Add the display name to `CLI_DISPLAY_NAMES` in `src/worker.ts` and `cliDisplayNames` in `card-builder.ts`
5. Add an option to the setup interactive menu in `src/cli.ts`
6. Update the README
