# Scheduled Tasks

Supports three schedule types plus natural-language input. Tasks run at their configured execution position when due. **In group chats, the default is chat top level, even when the task is created inside a topic.** To continue in the current topic, explicitly pass `--topic` when creating the task through the CLI, or select the original topic under **Execution position** in the Dashboard.

There are four execution positions: **chat top level** (the default; all top-level tasks in one group share the chat-scope session context), **a specified topic** (`--topic`, bound to one existing topic), **a new topic per run** (`--new-topic`, every run stands alone), and **a dedicated task topic** (opt-in; each task owns its own topic session — see below).

## Two Ways to Create

- **Slash command** (quick): `/schedule 每日17:50 帮我看看AI圈有什么新闻`
- **Conversational trigger** (flexible): just tell the agent "add me a scheduled task to check deployment every day at 18:00", which automatically triggers the `botmux-schedule` skill.

To create a task that stays in the current topic, run this inside its topic session:

```bash
botmux schedule add "0 18 * * *" "check deployment status" --topic
```

`--topic` can infer the anchor from the current topic session. Use `--root-msg-id <om_...>` to specify a target topic explicitly.

## Supported Formats

```

## Bash Preconditions (Dashboard)

Enable **Bash precondition** when a scheduled task should check external state before calling the model. This setting is available when creating or editing a task in the Dashboard. Turning the switch off disables the precondition, but the scheduled task continues to run and the saved content is retained. Clear the script or file path and save to remove it.

Two source modes are available:

- **Enter Bash directly**: the script content is stored with the task configuration.
- **Bash file path**: the file must be a readable, regular UTF-8 Bash file on the daemon host and must be inside the `<dataDir>/schedule-preconditions/trusted-files/` directory shown in the Dashboard for the current bot. The page also shows a complete absolute-path example that can be entered directly. Relative paths, paths using `~` expansion, directories, files outside this directory, and symbolic links in any path component are rejected.

### File-path configuration demo

Suppose the Dashboard shows the following values for the current bot:

```text
Trusted directory: /home/alice/.botmux/data/schedule-preconditions/trusted-files/
Complete example: /home/alice/.botmux/data/schedule-preconditions/trusted-files/check-ready.sh
```

This is a Linux example. Your actual `dataDir` may differ, so use the values shown in the Dashboard instead of copying the example username. Then:

1. On the **same host that runs the daemon**, create or copy a regular UTF-8 Bash file into the directory shown in the Dashboard. The daemon creates this directory.
2. Paste the complete absolute path into **Bash file path**. For this example, enter `/home/alice/.botmux/data/schedule-preconditions/trusted-files/check-ready.sh`, not `~/...`.
3. Click **Test precondition**. Save the task after the test passes.

You can start `check-ready.sh` with this minimal content:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Replace this with the state path to check on the daemon host.
if test -f /srv/my-service/ready.flag; then
  printf '1\n'
else
  printf '0\n'
fi
```

Botmux validates and reads the file again for every test and scheduled trigger. You do not need to save the task again after changing the file.

Both modes use the same protocol. The script must exit with code `0`, and trimmed stdout must be exactly `1`, before the task calls the model. Output `0`, any other output, empty output, or a script error stops that run.

To append context to the model prompt for this run, write it to file descriptor 3 (FD 3):

```bash
printf '1\n'
cat >&3 <<'PROMPT'
The deployment check passed. Use this status in the analysis.
PROMPT
```

Click **Test precondition** to execute the current **unsaved** form content for real on the daemon host. The result shows pass, skip, or the full error and exit codes. Testing does not save the configuration, call the model, write a task execution log, or advance repeat counts. File, network, and other side effects produced by the script still happen for real.

> **Migrating existing configurations:** File paths saved before this upgrade remain configured when they are outside the trusted directory, but tests and scheduled runs fail closed while the precondition is enabled, so the model is not called. Botmux does not copy the file or rewrite the task automatically. Move or copy the file into the current bot's trusted directory, update the field with the new complete absolute path, test it, and save. FD 3 content is sent to the model and may enter session history, so do not output secrets or tokens.

## A New Topic Per Run

For chat-top-level execution, the bot/chat session mode determines how messages are organized. To explicitly make each run land in a **brand-new topic** in the same chat with its own isolated session (ideal for daily-report style tasks where each run should stand alone), there are three ways:

```bash
# Slash command: prefix the prompt with the 新话题 ("new topic") keyword
/schedule 每日17:30 新话题 generate today's discussion digest

# CLI: --new-topic flag
botmux schedule add "每日17:30" "generate digest" --new-topic

# CLI: equivalent --deliver form
botmux schedule add "每日17:30" "generate digest" --deliver new-topic
```

You can also edit a task on the Dashboard's **Schedules** page and use **Execution position** to choose the original topic, chat top level, a new topic for every run, or the task's dedicated topic.

## A Dedicated Topic Per Task

"A new topic per run" keeps every run of the same task unrelated; chat top level goes the other way, with all top-level tasks in one group sharing one chat-scope session. A **dedicated task topic** gives each task a topic session that belongs to it alone:

- Every run of the same task lands in the **same topic**, so the context carries over — just like a topic-pinned task.
- Different tasks in the same group use separate topics and are **isolated from one another, never sharing context** — a sentinel task and a daily-report task never end up in the same session history.
- The topic is created **on the first fire**: a non-silent task posts a seed message (the "task started" banner) first, anchored as that topic's root; a silent task defers creation until the bot's first `botmux send`, exactly like "new topic per run" combined with silent.

How to set it:

- **Natural language**: prefix the prompt with the dedicated-topic keyword — `独立话题` / `专属话题` in Chinese, "dedicated topic" in English. It combines with the silent keyword in either order, for example:

```bash
/schedule 每日18:00 独立话题 summarize today's service health checks
/schedule 工作日9:00 静默 专属话题 write the morning brief; speak up only on anomalies
```

- **Lark schedule card / Dashboard**: on the card, the execution-position button cycles **chat top level → new topic per run → dedicated task topic → chat top level**; the Dashboard **Schedules** form lets you pick the position directly.

Limits and notes:

- **Single-group tasks only**; a multi-group task cannot choose the dedicated task topic.
- The per-task model behaves exactly like `--topic`: it applies only on the first fire that creates the session; later runs reuse the model that session started with (see the next section).

## Follow the Active Topic

A task explicitly pinned with `--topic` keeps firing into its specified topic; once that topic is closed and the conversation has moved on, reminders land where nobody is looking — and re-lighting a closed topic is one more topic session to carry. `--follow-active` makes the task re-resolve its target **at every fire**.

```bash
# Created from inside a topic session: that topic is the starting point
botmux schedule add "every 30m" "check the service, alert only on failure" --follow-active

# Or give the starting point explicitly
botmux schedule add "每日9:00" "standup reminder" --follow-active --root-msg-id om_xxx
```

Tried in order at every fire:

1. **The last landing point is still open and a human has spoken in it** (some bot still holds an active session under that topic, and that session has seen a human message) ⇒ fire there, even if the person spoke elsewhere more recently. Until the first fire, the last landing point is the creation topic.
2. **Otherwise** (closed; or open but only bots ever wrote there) ⇒ fire into the topic in this chat where a **human most recently spoke**, and record it as the new landing point. Only human messages count — bot replies and scheduled-task output are ignored, otherwise a task firing every 30 minutes would keep its own topic "most active" and follow itself forever. The lookup spans every bot: where the person is, is a property of the person, not of one bot. Note that this fire is injected into the person's live session, so the task's own `--workdir` does not apply there; the session's working directory is used.
3. **No open topic with human activity in this chat, but the last landing point is still open** (e.g. the topic step 4 opened, with only the task writing in it) ⇒ stay there; no new topic is opened.
4. **Nothing open at all** ⇒ this fire opens a fresh top-level topic, exactly like `--new-topic`, and records it as the new landing point — the next fire stays in it under step 3, and once the person replies there it is held under step 1.

Step 1 requiring a human is deliberate: a topic the task opened itself must not pin the task, so a bot-only landing point yields to any topic where a person is. If the session records cannot be read (e.g. sqlite temporarily unavailable) the task does not move and keeps its last landing point. A silent task reaching step 4 gets a deferred topic (created by the first `botmux send`), which is not recorded; the next fire re-resolves.

Cross-topic notice: a plain topic-pinned task that fires somewhere other than its creation topic posts a "delivered to …" notice back into the creation topic. A follow-active task moves by design, so it posts that notice only when it fires into a **different chat**; a move within the same chat just posts the "task started" banner in the topic it landed in.

`--follow-active` only makes sense for topic execution and cannot be combined with `--top-level` / `--new-topic`. Tasks of this kind show a `↷跟随活跃话题` marker in `schedule list`.

## A Model Per Task

Under one bot, different tasks usually deserve different model tiers: a sentinel firing every 30 minutes runs fine on a cheap model, while the nightly code review is the one that needs the strongest. `--model` / `--reasoning-effort` give a task its own model without touching the bot config or any other task.

```bash
# Frequent sentinel: cheap model, low effort
botmux schedule add "every 30m" "check service health, alert only on failure" \
  --silent --model gpt-5.2 --reasoning-effort low

# Once-a-day deep task: strongest model, highest effort
botmux schedule add "0 9 * * *" "review every PR merged to master yesterday" \
  --new-topic --model gpt-5.6-sol --reasoning-effort ultra
```

The Dashboard "Schedules" page has both fields too; empty means "follow the bot config".

**Only a run that creates a session can apply the model.** Model and reasoning effort are CLI **process launch** arguments (`codex --model X -c model_reasoning_effort=Y`) and cannot be changed once the process is up. So:

| Execution position | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--new-topic` | Every run starts a new session, so the model applies **every time** |
| Dedicated task topic / `--topic` / `--top-level` | Applies on the run that creates the session; later runs reuse it with the model it started with |

Use `--new-topic` when it must apply on every run. Both the CLI and the Dashboard say which case you are in when you save.

Supported CLIs are Codex, Claude Code, Grok and TraeX (the same gate as the trigger API's `options.model`); a task on any other CLI ignores both fields at fire time and logs a warning. Which effort levels exist depends on the model (`gpt-5.6-sol` goes up to `ultra`, `gpt-5.5` stops at `xhigh`), and the Dashboard rejects an unsupported pairing on save. If the bot later switches CLI, or the model stops offering the level, the fire **drops that field and runs anyway** with a warning — stale configuration never skips a run.

## Management

```bash
/schedule list
/schedule remove|enable|disable|run <id>
```

> Execution behavior: the execution position determines the target first. With an explicit `--topic`, an active session in the target topic receives the prompt directly (no new worker); otherwise, a new worker starts in the task's saved working directory. Chat-top-level tasks select a session according to the bot/chat session mode. `--new-topic` uses a fresh session for every run; combined with `--silent`, it creates the topic only when the first `botmux send` needs to deliver content. A dedicated task topic creates the task's own topic on its first fire (a non-silent run posts a seed message anchored as the root; a silent run defers materialization to the first `botmux send`), and every later run is appended to that same session.

> `--silent` suppresses only the task-start banner and normal successful output. Missing caller identity, unapproved or retired frozen commands, and execution failures are still delivered so a scheduled task cannot fail silently.

## Update a prompt in place

Use `update` to change an existing task without deleting and recreating it:

```bash
botmux schedule update <id> --prompt-file report-prompt.md
# For short prompts, use exactly one of these two input options.
botmux schedule update <id> --prompt "The complete replacement prompt"
```

Files are read as UTF-8 with line breaks preserved. Only the prompt changes: the task ID, schedule, enabled state, execution position and run history remain intact. Updating does not trigger a run. Already dispatched runs keep their original prompt; subsequent runs use the replacement. Input or authorization failures do not delete the task. Updates use the same locked atomic storage as other task operations.

For ownerless topics created by scheduled tasks, the host daemon authorizes the current caller without exposing bot configuration or credentials to the sandbox. Upgrade the CLI and daemon together: an older daemon without this authorization capability is rejected explicitly, without deleting the task or bypassing verification.

A task bound to a protected precondition cannot be changed with `update`: the precondition records a hash of the task input, while its definition file is host-only and cannot be rebound from inside the sandbox. Rewriting the prompt would make every later fire fail validation and stop the task silently. Edit such tasks on the Dashboard scheduled-tasks page instead.
